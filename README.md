# RedditZero
Recreation of a simple reddit application with minimal features using the Reddit JSON API. 

## Features
Basic feed using popular categories on Reddit, aka Subreddits.
A search bar that can be used to narrow the content in the feed.
Comment section is visible, but cannot be intereacted with.

## JSON API 
This API only requires that ".json" be added to the end of any of the Reddit URLs
The most notable limitation of this API is the absence of write operations as the API does not require an OAuth Token.

## Project Goals and Requirements
  * This project is built using React and Redux
  * Version Control using Git and Github
  * Use Jest and Enzyme to unit test the code
  * End-to-End Testing
  * Make the Application Responsive and Accessible
  * Enable a Search Bar Feature
  * Application is enhanced by design and Animation

### Future Goals
  * Hoping to use this project to get more comfortable with APIs and Testing
  * This Project can be expanded upon using the Official Reddit API
  * This Project is also a reat way to get more familiar with transitions and animations
